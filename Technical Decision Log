# Technical Decision Log

## Architecture: MVVM
**Date:** January 15, 2023
**Decision:** Use MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) architecture pattern
**Alternatives Considered:** MVC, VIPER, MVP
**Rationale:**
- Better separation of concerns compared to MVC
- Native support for SwiftUI with ObservableObject
- Easier unit testing of business logic in ViewModels
- Less complexity compared to VIPER for our current project scope

## UI Framework: SwiftUI
**Date:** January 15, 2023
**Decision:** Use SwiftUI for the user interface
**Alternatives Considered:** UIKit, hybrid approach
**Rationale:**
- Modern declarative UI framework with less boilerplate code
- Better support for animations and state management
- Faster development cycle with live previews
- Target audience uses iOS 14+ which fully supports SwiftUI
- Easier to implement dark mode and accessibility features

## Reactive Programming: Combine
**Date:** January 20, 2023
**Decision:** Use Combine for reactive programming
**Alternatives Considered:** RxSwift, ReactiveSwift
**Rationale:**
- Native Apple framework with tight integration with SwiftUI
- No additional dependencies required
- Sufficient functionality for our reactive programming needs
- Better long-term support from Apple

## Data Persistence: CoreData
**Date:** February 5, 2023
**Decision:** Use CoreData for local data storage
**Alternatives Considered:** Realm, SQLite, UserDefaults
**Rationale:**
- Native Apple framework with good integration with SwiftUI
- Support for complex data relationships needed for our product and chat models
- Offline-first approach requires robust local storage
- Built-in migration capabilities for future app updates

## Image Loading and Caching: Kingfisher
**Date:** February 10, 2023
**Decision:** Use Kingfisher for image loading and caching
**Alternatives Considered:** SDWebImage, AlamofireImage, custom implementation
**Rationale:**
- Excellent performance and memory management
- SwiftUI support with KFImage
- Comprehensive caching system reduces network usage
- Active maintenance and community support

## Authentication: Firebase Auth
**Date:** March 1, 2023
**Decision:** Use Firebase Authentication for user authentication
**Alternatives Considered:** Custom auth system, Auth0, AWS Cognito
**Rationale:**
- Easy implementation with comprehensive SDK
- Support for multiple authentication methods (email, social)
- Scalable solution that handles security best practices
- Integration with other Firebase services we plan to use

## Privacy Implementation: Custom Encryption
**Date:** March 15, 2023
**Decision:** Implement custom end-to-end encryption for chat messages
**Alternatives Considered:** Third-party encryption libraries, Firebase security rules
**Rationale:**
- Higher level of privacy control required for our privacy-focused app
- Need for end-to-end encryption not provided by standard solutions
- Custom implementation allows for future enhancements specific to our use case

## Technical Change: Migration from CoreData to CloudKit
**Date:** September 10, 2023
**Decision:** Migrate from CoreData-only to CoreData with CloudKit
**Previous Approach:** CoreData for local storage only
**Rationale:**
- Enable cross-device synchronization requested by users
- Maintain existing CoreData model while adding cloud capabilities
- Better privacy compared to Firebase (important for our privacy-focused app)
- Native Apple solution with good integration with our existing architecture

## Performance Optimization: LazyVGrid Implementation
**Date:** October 5, 2023
**Decision:** Replace standard Grid with LazyVGrid for product listing
**Previous Approach:** Standard Grid with all items loaded at once
**Rationale:**
- Significant performance improvement with large product catalogs
- Reduced memory usage by loading only visible cells
- Better scrolling performance on older devices
- Preparation for future infinite scrolling feature
