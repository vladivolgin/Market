## Architecture Overview

The Marketplace App is developed using the MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) architecture, ensuring a clean separation of concerns and making the components easier to test. The user interface is built with SwiftUI, and asynchronous operations are handled using Swift's modern concurrency features (`async/await`).

## Requirements

- iOS 14.0+
- Xcode 12.0+
- Swift 5.3+

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
   git clone https://github.com/vladivolgin/Market.git

```

Project Setup
Open the project file in Xcode:

### Key Components

1.  **Models** - Swift structures that represent the main entities of the application, directly mapping to the collections in the Firestore database.
    - `User` - Represents a user's public profile.
    - `Product` - An item listed for sale.
    - `Chat` & `Message` - Represent a conversation and its individual messages.
    - `ForumTopic` & `Reply` - Represent a forum post and its replies.
    - `News` - An article in the news feed.
    - `Review` - A rating and comment for a seller.

2.  **Views** - A hierarchy of SwiftUI views responsible for displaying the user interface.
    - `MarketplaceView` - Main screen for browsing and searching items.
    - `ProductDetailView` - Shows detailed information about a single product.
    - `ChatListView` & `ChatDetailView` - For managing and participating in conversations.
    - `ForumView` - Displays a list of community topics.
    - `NewsView` - The application's news feed.
    - `ProfileView` - Displays user information and their listed items.
    - `AddProductView` - The form for adding a new item.

3.  **ViewModels** - Classes that hold the state and business logic for the Views, processing user input and preparing data for display.
    - `ProfileViewModel` - Manages the logic for the user profile screen.
    - `MessengerViewModel` - Handles the state for the chat interface.
    - `AddProductViewModel` - Manages the logic for adding a new product.

4.  **Services** - Singleton or shared instances that encapsulate major functionalities and interactions with the backend.
    - `DataManager` - Acts as a repository, handling all CRUD operations with the Firestore database.
    - `AuthManager` - Manages the user authentication lifecycle with Firebase Authentication.
    - `StorageManager` - Handles uploading and downloading images from Firebase Cloud Storage.

### Description:

This diagram illustrates the main actions available to the User within the application. It covers the key features of the system, grouped by module:
Marketplace: Browsing, searching, publishing, and managing items.
Communication: Interacting with other users via private messages and leaving reviews.
Community: Engaging with the community through the forum and reading news.
Authentication: Registering and signing into the system.
The diagram provides a high-level overview of the system's functionality and how the user interacts with it.

## Software Architecture Schemas
### Logical architecture
<img width="758" alt="Снимок экрана 2025-04-21 в 22 43 46" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e92fbc07-b83b-4016-b0c8-f7de0c2cd6be" />

This schema is a representation of the functionality of the application at this stage of development.

### Description

The Logical Architecture diagram demonstrates the application's internal structure and its division into layers. It shows how components are organized to ensure clean code and separation of concerns, following the MVVM pattern.
Presentation Layer (View): Consists of SwiftUI Views, responsible solely for displaying the UI and forwarding user actions.
Business Logic Layer (ViewModel): Where ViewModels manage the state for the Views, handle user input logic, and prepare data for display.
Service/Manager Layer: A layer of services (AuthManager, DataManager) that encapsulates the logic for interacting with external systems, primarily Firebase.
Model Layer: Contains data structures (Product, User, etc.) that mirror the entities in the Firestore database.
Backend Services (Firebase): The external layer providing services like Authentication, Firestore database, and Cloud Storage.

### Physical Architecture
<img width="988" alt="Снимок экрана 2025-04-21 в 20 51 23" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a81a8b4e-d075-46ac-97b9-14cf12f24352" />

### Description:

This diagram shows the physical deployment of the system's components. It illustrates the client-server model, where:
Client: The user's iOS device (iPhone/iPad) running the mobile application built with SwiftUI.
Backend: The Google Cloud platform, which hosts the managed Firebase services. This includes Firestore (database), Firebase Authentication, and Cloud Storage (for images).
Communication between the client and backend occurs over the secure HTTPS protocol, ensuring all data is encrypted in transit.
## Database schema
<img width="989" alt="Снимок экрана 2025-04-21 в 21 41 31" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/97d8dcd5-6c1e-4a01-9f6e-9b42b742b54d" />

This schema is a representation of the functionality of the application at this stage of development.
## Sequence diagram
<img width="1005" alt="Снимок экрана 2025-04-21 в 19 21 24" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ae37ab29-b397-49e0-9145-52f916424b09" />

#### Description:

The Sequence Diagram demonstrates the dynamic interaction between system components to perform a specific scenario. The process of "Adding a New Item" is shown as an example.
It illustrates the following steps:
The user fills out the form in AddProductView and taps 'Save'.
The View calls a method on its ViewModel.
The ViewModel first uploads the image to Cloud Storage.
After receiving the image URL, the ViewModel creates a Product object.
It then calls the DataManager to save the new document to the products collection in Firestore.
Upon successful saving, the ViewModel updates the UI to inform the user of the success.
This diagram clearly shows how client-side components interact with each other and with various Firebase services to complete a single business task.

Human Interface Guidelines

## Error Handling Strategy
Network Interaction Level: All network errors are handled in API services and converted to NetworkError.
```Data Level```: Data-related errors are handled in ```DataManager``` and converted to ```DataError```.
Presentation Level: ViewModel handles errors and provides appropriate messages for display to the user.
## Error Handling Example
```swift
func fetchProducts() {
    isLoading = true
    errorMessage = nil
    
    apiService.getProducts { [weak self] result in
        guard let self = self else { return }
        
        self.isLoading = false
        
        switch result {
        case .success(let products):
            self.products = products
        case .failure(let error):
            switch error {
            case .noInternet:
                self.errorMessage = "No internet connection"
            case .unauthorized:
                self.errorMessage = "Authentication required"
                self.authManager.signOut()
            case .serverError(let code):
                self.errorMessage = "Server error: \(code)"
            default:
                self.errorMessage = "An error occurred while loading products"
            }
            
            self.logError(error)
        }
    }
}

```
## Coding Conventions
Naming
### Types (classes, structures, enums, protocols):
Use PascalCase (e.g., ProductDetailView, NetworkError)
Names should be nouns
### Variables and Functions:
Use camelCase (e.g., productList, fetchProducts())
Function names should start with a verb
### Constants:
For global constants, use the k prefix (e.g., kMaxRetryCount)
For static constants, use camelCase (e.g., static let maxRetryCount = 3)
### Abbreviations:
Common abbreviations (URL, ID) should be written in uppercase
For other abbreviations, use camelCase
```swift
## File Structure
Code Organization in a File:

   // 1. Imports
   import SwiftUI
   import Combine
   
   // 2. Protocols
   protocol ProductsViewModelProtocol { }
   
   // 3. Main Class/Structure
   class ProductsViewModel: ObservableObject, ProductsViewModelProtocol {
       // 3.1 Properties
       @Published var products: [Product] = []
       
       // 3.2 Initializers
       init() { }
       
       // 3.3 Public Methods
       func fetchProducts() { }
       
       // 3.4 Private Methods
       private func processProducts(_ products: [Product]) { }
   }
   
   // 4. Extensions
   extension ProductsViewModel {
       func additionalFunctionality() { }
   }
```
# Function Header Comments

## Purpose
Function header comments are critical for my codebase as they document exactly what each function does, what inputs it expects, and what outputs it provides. I've found that well-documented functions make it much easier for me to revisit my code months later, and they're essential when collaborating with other developers

## Format
We use a standardized format for function header comments based on Swift's documentation comments (triple slash `///`):
```swift
/// Brief description of what the function does
///
/// More detailed explanation if needed. This can span
/// multiple lines and provide additional context.
///
/// - Parameters:
///   - paramName1: Description of first parameter
///   - paramName2: Description of second parameter
/// - Returns: Description of the return value
/// - Throws: Description of potential errors that can be thrown
/// - Note: Any additional notes or warnings
/// - Example:
///   ```swift
///   let result = myFunction(param1: "value", param2: 42)
///   // result will be...
///   
func myFunction(paramName1: String, paramName2: Int) -> Result {
    // Implementation
}
```
## Grouping Files in the Project:
Group files by functionality, not by type
For example: ```/Features/ProductList/ ``` instead of ```/Views/ and /ViewModels/```

## Formatting
### Indentation:
Use 4 spaces for indentation
Do not use tabs
### Braces:
Opening brace on the same line
Closing brace on a new line
### Maximum Line Length:
100 characters
### Spaces:
Space after comma
Space before and after operators
No spaces inside parentheses
## SwiftUI Conventions
### Modifiers:
Each modifier on a new line
Group related modifiers 
## Code Example(Ai-Generated)
```swift
   Text("Hello, World!")
       .font(.headline)
       .foregroundColor(.primary)
       
       .padding()
       .background(Color.secondary.opacity(0.2))
       .cornerRadius(10)
```
### Preview:
Add a preview for each View
Use different device sizes and themes
